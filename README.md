In this paper, we present the potential of generalization for a RescueNet
data-trained damage estimation model towards evaluating natural dis-
asters which occured in december 2024 to a French island, namely
Mayotte. Indeed, more and more disasters occur over the world and
affect people lifes; notably in reason of climate changes. Intelligent disas-
ter evaluation models previously require a huge amount of representative
disaster data in order to be trained efficiently. Indeed, after a mas-
sive disaster, aerial images are usually collected in order to evaluate
the disaster impact at a large scale. We propose a transfer learn-
ing approach that exploits massively collected disaster data (coming
from the Hurricane Michael) which are publicly available towards esti-
mating the damage severity over another disaster, namely Mayotte
(Cyclone Chido). In particular, data preparation and adaptation stages
have been exploited towards permitting an estimation of damages. The
generalizability potential of an efficient RescueNet model is evaluated
by comparing its damage predictions over Mayotte image datasets.
